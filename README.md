## Submission

1. Modify the contents of the `exercise.py` file to write your program.
2. Use the GitHub online editor to commit and push your changes. (See below for detailed instructions)
3. At the Actions tab of your Github repository, please check the result.

## How to Use the GitHub Online Editor

* Press the <kbd>.</kbd> key while viewing the files in your repository on GitHub. This will launch a web version of VS Code.
* Make your changes to the `exercise.py` file.
* To commit your changes, click on the branch icon on the left sidebar (the third icon after the magnifying glass).
* Click the "+" sign next to the filename to stage your changes.
* Write a brief description of your changes in the text box above.
* Click "Commit & Push."
* Click "Back to Repository" on the branch icon to return to your repository.

## Writing Descriptive Git Commit Messages

* To help you develop a better coding habits, we encourage descriptive Git commit messages when committing changes to your repositroy.
* A good commit message clearly explains what you changed and why, making it easier for you to understand your work later.

### Guidelines for Commit Messages
* Describe the change more specifically, e.g., "Add factorial function to exercise.py" or "Fix bug in sum calculation".
* Use Action Verbs: Start with words like "Add", "Fix", "Update", or "Refactor".

* Avoid Vague Messages: Messages like "update" or "fix" can be too general.

* Keep It Concise: Aim for 15-50 characters, but ensure clarity.
* Examples 예:
  * Good: "Add unit tests for sort function in exercise.py"
  * Bad: "update", "fix 1", "changed file"

### Why It Matters
* Clear commit messages improve collaboration, debugging, and code review in real-world projects.
